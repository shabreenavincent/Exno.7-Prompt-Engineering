## Aim: 
To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.
## Algorithm:
Develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

## Objective:
To demonstrate the development of a prompt-driven assistant for organizing daily tasks, planning, or other productivity-related functions. This includes progressing from basic prompts to advanced, context-aware prompts that simulate real-world assistant behaviors.

## Procedure:
### Step 1: Identify a Personal or Functional Need
Start by defining the purpose of the application. Some example use cases include:

a. Daily task planner

b. Meal or fitness scheduler

c. Study routine assistant

d. Mental wellness check-in bot

e. Writing or content creation helper

In this case, we will create a Daily Task Organizer.

### Step 2: Define the Basic Functionality
Draft a simple prompt that asks the model to perform the core task.

#### Example Prompt (Basic):
“Help me organize my tasks for today: buy groceries, complete homework, attend meeting at 3 PM.”

#### Expected Output:
A basic bulleted list or ordered schedule with time estimates.

### Step 3: Refine the Prompt with More Context
Add user preferences, time constraints, and desired output style.

#### Refined Prompt:
“Organize these tasks into a daily schedule between 9 AM and 6 PM, including breaks and priority order:

Buy groceries

Complete homework

Attend meeting at 3 PM
I prefer to do creative tasks in the morning and errands after lunch.”

#### Expected Output:
A time-blocked schedule that reflects the user's routine and productivity patterns.

### Step 4: Include Smart Features via Prompt Expansion
Introduce adaptive elements such as suggestions, reminders, and motivational tips.

#### Advanced Prompt:
“Based on my productivity preferences (creative tasks in the morning, physical errands in the afternoon), generate a smart day plan from 9 AM to 6 PM with short breaks every 90 minutes. Include motivational quotes before major tasks. Tasks:

Finish presentation

Grocery shopping

Team meeting at 3 PM

30-minute walk”

#### Expected Output:

A motivational quote or message

Time-specific tasks with context-aware placement

Inclusion of self-care and breaks

### Step 5: Simulate an Interactive Prompt-Based Application
Transform prompts into a dynamic interaction, simulating how a user would engage with an app.

#### Initial User Prompt:
“Create my task plan for the day.”

#### Model Response:
“As a starting point, please list your tasks, your available time window, and how you prefer to structure your day (e.g., focused work first, errands later).”

#### Follow-up Prompt:
“Tasks: Write blog, dentist appointment at 2 PM, laundry. Time: 10 AM – 5 PM. Prefer writing early, and errands after.”

#### Model Output:
A well-organized schedule including a writing block, appointment slot, and buffer times.

### Step 6: Add Personalization for Reuse
Encourage reusable and user-specific prompts that simulate memory or personal tracking.

#### Custom Prompt Template for Reuse:
“Based on my previous schedule template, generate a day plan including the following tasks: [tasks]. Use the usual format and include motivational tips.”

This can act as a pseudo-app behavior where the model “remembers” patterns based on structured prompt reuse.


## Conclusion:
This experiment showcases how large language models like ChatGPT can be used to build prompt-powered applications that adapt to users’ daily needs. By gradually enhancing the complexity and intent of the prompts, users can craft highly personalized, functional digital assistants—all without coding.

This process fosters not only creativity but also critical thinking and practical problem-solving, as users learn how to structure inputs for maximum impact.

# Result: 
The Prompt is executed successfully
